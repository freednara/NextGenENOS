## üìù Notes

### Technical Decisions

- **Smoke Tests**: Simplified LWC testing due to Jest environment limitations
- **Category System**: Implemented as custom object for flexibility and scalability
- **SFDMU Integration**: Chose sfdx-hardis for robust data migration capabilities
- **Security First**: Implemented comprehensive security patterns from the start

### Known Limitations

- **Enterprise Features**: Some features require Enterprise Edition (noted in components)
- **Testing Environment**: LWC Jest environment has rendering limitations
- **Data Volume**: Current sample data covers 20 products (expandable via SFDMU)

### Maintenance Considerations

- **Regular Updates**: Use SFDMU for ongoing data synchronization
- **Security Reviews**: Periodic validation of permission sets and sharing rules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track SOQL query performance and optimization opportunities
- **User Training**: Community user onboarding and feature documentation
