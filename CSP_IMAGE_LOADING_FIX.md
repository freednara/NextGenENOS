# üî• CSP Image Loading Fix Guide

## üìã **Issue Description**
Your Salesforce org is blocking external product images due to Content Security Policy (CSP) violations. You're seeing errors like:

```
Refused to load the image '<URL>' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src 'self' ..."
```

## üéØ **Root Cause**
The CSP policy in your Salesforce org doesn't include the domains where your product images are hosted (e.g., `https://example.com`).

## üîß **Solution: Add Image Domains to CSP Trusted Sites**

### **Step 1: Navigate to CSP Trusted Sites**
1. Go to **Setup** in Salesforce
2. In the Quick Find box, type **"CSP Trusted Sites"**
3. Click **CSP Trusted Sites**

### **Step 2: Add Your Image Domains**
1. Click **New**
2. Fill in the following details:
   - **Trusted Site Name**: `Product Images`
   - **Trusted Site URL**: `https://example.com` (replace with your actual image domain)
   - **Context**: Check **Communities** and **Lightning Pages**
   - **Description**: `Allow loading of product images from external CDN`

3. **Repeat for each domain** where you host product images

### **Step 3: Common Image Domains to Add**
Based on your logs, you might need to add:
- `https://example.com` (your main image domain)
- `*.cloudinary.com` (if using Cloudinary)
- `*.amazonaws.com` (if using AWS S3)
- Any other domains where your product images are hosted

### **Step 4: Test the Fix**
1. Save the CSP Trusted Sites
2. Refresh your product catalog page
3. Check the browser console for CSP violations
4. Verify that product images now load properly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Security Considerations**
- Only add domains you trust
- Avoid using wildcards (`*`) unless necessary
- Consider using relative URLs or Salesforce file storage when possible

### **Alternative Solutions**
1. **Upload images to Salesforce Files**: Store product images in Salesforce instead of external domains
2. **Use Salesforce CDN**: Leverage Salesforce's built-in file hosting
3. **Proxy through your domain**: Serve images through your own domain that's already trusted

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Check Current CSP Policy**
1. Open browser console on any Salesforce page
2. Look for CSP header information
3. Verify your domains are included in the `img-src` directive

### **Test Image Loading**
1. Navigate to your product catalog
2. Check if product images display properly
3. Look for any remaining CSP violations in console

## üìû **If Issues Persist**

### **Check with Salesforce Support**
- CSP policies can be complex
- Some restrictions may be org-level settings
- Support can help verify your configuration

### **Alternative Approach**
- Consider migrating images to Salesforce Files
- Use base64 encoded images for small product images
- Implement a custom image proxy service

## üéâ **Expected Result**
After adding the correct domains to CSP Trusted Sites:
- ‚úÖ Product images load without CSP violations
- ‚úÖ No more "Refused to load image" errors in console
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience with visible product images
- ‚úÖ Better conversion rates due to visual product presentation
